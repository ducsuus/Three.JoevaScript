I don't even know what this is, let the randomness begin

# Introduction

This project uses the WebGL JavaScript library Three.js to provide a first-person-shooter style game.

Most of this won't be (or wasn't) planned and the project will work almost in reverse; it will start with an unlimited amount of possibilties, as it progresses more limitations will be added until a focused game is produced.
